## Overview

This project focuses on the reconstruction of cardiac ultrasound images using phased array transducer techniques. It applies advanced signal processing and beamforming methods to enhance the quality and accuracy of echocardiographic imaging, crucial for diagnosing cardiovascular conditions.

## Features

- **Ultrasound Signal Processing**:
  - Simulation of **diverging-wave echocardiography** for cardiac imaging
  - Application of **seven diverging waves with a 60-degree aperture**
  - Beamforming techniques to reconstruct a five-chamber heart view
- **Advanced Image Reconstruction Techniques**:
  - **Delay-and-Sum (DAS) Beamforming** for signal focusing
  - **I/Q Demodulation** to simplify RF signals for processing
  - **Time-Gain Compensation (TGC)** to enhance signal consistency across depths
- **Medical & Industry Applications**:
  - High-resolution **echocardiography for heart disease diagnosis**
  - AI-driven **ultrasound imaging enhancement for clinical applications**
  - Improved **real-time cardiac imaging for non-invasive diagnostics**

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
2. Run each section to simulate ultrasound signal acquisition and processing.
3. Apply beamforming techniques to reconstruct high-quality cardiac ultrasound images.
4. Evaluate the final output and analyze reconstructed images for medical applications.
